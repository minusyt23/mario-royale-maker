repository for mario royale maker.

this code is made in python 3 but be sure to have python 3.5 or greater due to a built-in function that was added in that version.

you have to install the following python modules:

wxpython

numpy

requests

scikit-image

if it doesn't work please ping me in the Mario Royale discord server.
